"""CaloChallenge shower observables -- the ``features_fn`` for real data.

``evaluate(real, gen, features_fn=...)`` maps raw samples to physics features
before any metric runs. This module supplies that function for CaloChallenge
voxelised showers, turning an ``(N, n_voxels)`` array of energy deposits into
the high-level observables physicists actually use to judge shower quality.

Definitions follow the CaloChallenge 2022 paper (arXiv:2410.21611), section on
high-level features:

* ``E_tot``     total deposited energy, sum over all voxels
* ``f_samp``    sampling fraction, E_tot / E_inc
* ``<z>``       longitudinal centre of gravity, energy-weighted mean layer
* ``sigma_z``   longitudinal width, energy-weighted RMS in layer
* ``<r>``       transverse centre of gravity, energy-weighted mean radius
* ``sigma_r``   transverse width, energy-weighted RMS in radius
* ``sparsity``  fraction of voxels with zero energy

**Voxel ordering.** The flattened voxel axis is ``(layer, alpha, r)`` -- layer
slowest, radius fastest. This was determined empirically from ds2 rather than
assumed: under this ordering the radial profile falls off monotonically by a
factor ~50 from core to edge and the angular profile is flat to 0.3%
(azimuthal symmetry, as it must be). Under the transposed ordering the radial
profile is a physically impossible sawtooth. Getting this backwards leaves
``<z>`` looking plausible while silently corrupting ``sigma_r``, so
``test_observables.py`` asserts the convention on synthetic showers.

**Radial coordinate.** By default radius is the bin *index* (0.5, 1.5, ...),
a monotonic proxy that is correct up to the radial binning. The real detector
bins are not equal width; for exact CaloChallenge parity pass the official bin
centres via ``Geometry(..., r_centers=...)``.
