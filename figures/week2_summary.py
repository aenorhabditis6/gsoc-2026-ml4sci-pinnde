"""Two figures for the 21 September 2026 talk: what else we tried.

Companion to ``week_summary.py``, which covers the empty-layer fix. This one
covers the parameterizations that were tested and rejected, and the physical
validity checks. Numbers are named by the run that produced them; 8000
evaluation showers each.
